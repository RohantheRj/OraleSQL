			ORACLE
			------
-->ORACLE  is an RDBMS( RELATIONAL DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM )
-->RDBMS is a software through which we can store data, access data
   and manage business data.
-->Oracle is an RDBMS s/w product from oracle corporation.

Ex of RDBMS: 
------------
ORACLE
SQL SERVER
DB2
INGRESS
MANGO DB
MYSQL
TERADATA. . . etc

[ Known as entities / Objects ]


What is a business?
Business is a collection of entities and its activities.

In early days of a business, we have very limited like

--limited number of emps
--limited depts
--limited products
--limited customers

Day-By-Day the business may improve, then we have the 
increasing of data size. 
In this case we need the automated system called DBMS, 
to maintain business data automatically.


DATA BASE CONCEPTS:
*******************
DATA:
collection of information of one Business entity is known 
as data.

Ex:	one employee information
	one product information
	one sales transaction information


DATA BASE:
**********
It is a software which stores and manages the collection 
of information of all objects in the business.	
It is a collection of programs and each program is 
specific for performing a task.


DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
***************************
DB which is combined with management system services is 
known as DBMS.
Here the services are

	--Entering new data
	--updating old data with new data
	--Deleting unwanted data
	--Authenticating the users
	--Providing security.


RDBMS:
******
Author of RDBMS IS E.F. CODD and he invented 12 Rules 
for an RDBMS.
Collection of information of all related objects with 
in the business is known as RDBMS.
The relation between the tables is implemented by using 
Referential integrity constraints.

In any RDBMS
--data stored in the form of 2-dimensional tables
--A table is a collection of rows and columns.
--A row is known as record ( collection of columns)
--A column is known as a field.



		
History of Oracle:
******************

ORACLE
	oracle is s/w developed by oracle corp. 
	established in 1977 ( Relational s/w incorp.)
	In 1979 it became as ORACLE CORP.
	The commercial version of oracle DB s/w was 
	released in 1986.


oracle-7	
	It is a stand alone rdbms, it is not supporting online 
	processing.
oracle-8
	It is a stand alone rdbms, and it is having indexes.

oracle-8i
	it is supporting internet applications like webpages 
	( html / java)
	It supports online data processing.

oracle-9i
	It is also supporting internet applications
	It supports online data processing
	It supports e-buz development tools 
	(ERP--Enterprise Resource Planning-- 
	[Oracle Apps] MOdules )


oracle-10g ( grid technology )
	A grid is nothing but a mesh like architecture. 
	Each crossection point in the mesh, is considered 
	as server.
	Each server is connected with at least one server 
	with in the grid.

advantage:
	Then there is no communication gap between the 
	DB servers
	And we can process the business data in 
	centralized manner.

oracle-11g ( grid technology )
	It is having in built data warehouse builder. 
	( OWB-tool [ Oracle Warehouse Builder ] )



oracle-12c ( supporting cloud computing )
	It is a multitenant database. 
	It will reduce cost of business implementation.
	Sharing of tech and data is easy.

Oracle-18c
	It is known as Autonomous cloud database.
