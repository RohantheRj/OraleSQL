		SQL ( Structured query language )
		----------------------------------
Def:	
It is a collection of pre defined commands, Operators, concepts, 
clauses, objects and Built in functions.

	It is the own language of any data base. 
	It is used to communicate with any database.
	By using this language we can write english like statements,
	called QUERIES.
	We will write these queries in any client tool and execute them, 
	then we will get result from database.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLIENT TOOLS:
*************

SQL*PLUS:-
**********
SQL * PLUS is a default client tool and acts as an interface between client user
and database.

		  	       <------------------------V


-->Sql * plus is a client tool to interact with ORACLE DB /any DB
-->Sql * plus is to be installed in to the system whenever we have installed 
	the db software.
-->Client [ Technical ] request is submitted in the form of "Queries".
-->Queries are executed by SQL STMT EXECUTOR ( Under Oracle Db Engine )
-->Queries are executed against database and output will be displayed on 
	the sql * plus window.


Features of Queries under sql * plus:
*************************************
--At a time only one query is allowed to execute.
--sql queries are not case sensitive.
--Each query is terminated with ;
--SQL commands are ANSI standard 
   ( American National standard institute ).
  So SQL commands are universally accepted by any RDBMS.
